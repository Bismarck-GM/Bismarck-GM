## Hello there 👋

### Welcome to my GitHub Account :octocat:.

I enjoy learning and building different kinds of projects. I'm into all kinds of technologies and always love to learn new things.

Here you can watch what I've done since I committed to the journey of becoming a Full Stack Developer, a dream I have since I was a child.

  <summary>A little bit about me.</summary>
  <br>

  I'm from Argentina and worked most of my adult life in the Real State business. 
  Also worked attending customers in all different kinds of business. 
  I like to recognize good and bad services. Love feedback about everything, if given positively and honest, better.

  And like I suppose everybody does I love Life in the most meaningful way of the word. I consider every little detail counts.

  I'm a Drummer 🥁. And I think music is essential in everyday life. I use to hear a ton of genres, mostly 🎸Heavy-Metal🎸 drove.

  And lastly, for a couple of years, I've been committed to introspect and add healthy improvements to my life. Jogging/running, home training (calisthenics), quit smoking 🚭 , and eating healthy.

<summary>Why Bismarck?</summary>
<br>
Because at the time of building my GitHub account I was hearing 'all day long' a song from Sabaton called Bismarck.

Also I like WW2 histories and machinery created in which was the world's biggest conflict to date. And, Bismarck was a show of what we, as humans, can build. It was a real 'monster of the sea', with a ton of issues, but still managed to be an imponent piece of human-created machinery.
