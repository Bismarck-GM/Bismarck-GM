## Hello there 👋

### Welcome to my GitHub Account :octocat:.

I enjoy learning and building different kinds of projects. I'm into all kinds of technologies and always love to learn new things.

Here you can watch what I've done since I committed to the journey of becoming a Full Stack Developer, a dream I have since I was a child.

<details>
  <summary>A little bit about me.</summary>
  <br>

  - I'm from Argentina and worked most of my adult life in the Real State business. 
  Also worked attending customers in all different kinds of business.
  - I like to recognize good and bad services. Love feedback about everything, if given positively and honest, better.

  - Like I suppose everybody does I love Life in the most meaningful way of the word. I consider every little detail counts.

  - 🥁 I'm a Drummer . And I think music is essential in everyday life. I use to hear a ton of genres, mostly 🎸Heavy-Metal🎸 drove.

  - 🛰️ Big fan of Space, Astronomy and Rocketry.

  - And lastly, for a couple of years, I've been committed to introspect and add healthy improvements to my life.
    - 🏃‍♂️ Jogging/running,
    - 🏋️ home training (calisthenics),
    - 🚭 no smoking,
    - 🍒 and eating healthy.

  <summary>Why Bismarck?</summary>
  <br>
  Because at the time of building my GitHub account I was hearing 'all day long' a song from Sabaton called Bismarck.<br>
  Also, I like WW2 histories and machinery created in which was the world's biggest conflict to date. And, Bismarck was a show of what we, as humans, can build. It was a real 'monster of the sea', with a ton of issues, but still managed to be an imponent piece of human-created machinery.
